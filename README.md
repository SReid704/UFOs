# UFOs

## Overview

Creating a webpage and Dynamic table to provide analysis of UFO sightings. Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis by allowing webpages users to filter for multiple criteria at the sametime. Filters include: city, state, country, and shape. These filters will be added to specify and give you a deeper dive into the UFO sightings. JavaScript and Bootstrap will be used to crate this webpage.

Using Bootstrap and JavaScript we create the webpage above. When you first open the page you will get "The Truth is out there title" as well as an introduction to the webpage and why it was created. You will learn what Ugologist have weighed in. Below this information you will see the table of UFO sightings.

This table has 5 filters you can use once entering the website. Those 5 filters include: Date,City,State,Country,and shape. You are able to reduce the table list by applying these filters for what you are looking for. You can use multiple filters at one time to further inspect and take a deeper dive into the data.

## Summary

We have helped Dana create an HTML webpage that will allow the users to filter in to the details of UFO sightings based on the filters we have created. This webpage is clean and concise; which makes it easier for users to read and analyze results. One drawback of this design is not including the source of the data to prove its validaty. With a source the user can do more research. This website can be improved by adding a link in the table for images of some of these UFO sightings. This can help user see if they are seeing the same type of UFOs other users are seeing. I would also recommend a video source on the website to draw more individuals in and understanding they are not alone when it comes to these findings.
